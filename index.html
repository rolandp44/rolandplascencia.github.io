    <h1>About me - Roland Plascencia</h1>
    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>In my senior year, I played on an undersized football team. I realized quickly that leadership isn’t about barking orders; it’s about creating an environment where everyone feels supported.
        When I saw the underclassmen struggling, I didn't just give them the "what" I gave them the "why." I went back to the fundamentals, explaining the reasons behind every movement. Even when tensions rose between players, 
        I stepped in to defuse the situation individually, prioritizing the unity of the group over ego. By keeping the atmosphere light with humor but stern with expectations, I watched a struggling group become the most unified 
        unit on the team. To me, leadership is building a bond with empathy, consistency, and trust.</p>
    <h3>Resilience</h3>
    <p>The most defining parts of my life have come from the challenges that forced me to restart. At 14, I was separated from my parents, losing the stability I had known my entire life. I entered high school lost, and for a long time, 
        I used football as my only anchor. While football taught me how to take hits and keep pushing, I eventually realized I was using it to mask deeper emotional struggles. When I hit a low point in my junior year, I had to stop and 
        rethink who I was outside of the sport.</p>
    <h3>What I learned from the "rebuild":</h4>
    <h4>Academic Drive:</h4>
    <p>I recognized that my past grades reflected my survival mode, not my potential. I am now committed to bringing the same work ethic I had on the field into the classroom.</p>
    <h4>Emotional Resilience:</h4>
    <p>Spending time in deep mindfulness taught me how to balance my life and reconnect with my original passions.</p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>I am more than just a student, an athlete, or an artist. I am someone who has lost their identity and had the strength to build a better one from scratch. Whether I am leading a team, designing a map, or tackling a new academic 
        challenge, I bring a perspective shaped by resilience and a drive to create things that bring people joy.</p>
