        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Roland Plascencia</strong></p>

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            In my senior year, I played on an undersized football team. I realized quickly that leadership isn’t about barking orders; it’s about creating an environment where everyone feels supported.
            When I saw the underclassmen struggling, I didn’t just give them the <em>what</em>I gave them the <em>why</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went back to the fundamentals, explaining the reasons behind every movement. Even when tensions rose between players, I stepped in to defuse situations individually, prioritizing unity over ego.
            By keeping the atmosphere light with humor but firm with expectations, I watched a struggling group become the most unified unit on the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            To me, leadership is about building bonds through empathy, consistency, and trust.
        </p>

        <h3>Resilience</h3>
        <p>
            The most defining parts of my life have come from challenges that forced me to restart. At 14, I was separated from my parents, losing the stability I had known my entire life.
            I entered high school lost, using football as my only anchor.
        </p>
        <p>
            While football taught me how to take hits and keep pushing, I eventually realized I was using it to mask deeper emotional struggles.
            When I hit a low point in my junior year, I had to stop and rethink who I was outside of the sport.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned From the Rebuild</h3>

        <h4>Academic Drive</h4>
        <p>
            I recognized that my past grades reflected survival mode, not my potential.
            I am now committed to bringing the same work ethic I had on the field into the classroom.
        </p>

        <h4>Emotional Resilience</h4>
        <p>
            Spending time in mindfulness taught me how to balance my life and reconnect with my original passions.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
            <p>
                I am more than just a student or an athlete.
                I am someone who lost their identity and had the strength to rebuild it.
                Whether I am leading a team or tackling a new academic challenge,
                I bring a perspective shaped by resilience and a drive to create things that bring people joy.
