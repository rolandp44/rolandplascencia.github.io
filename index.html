    <h1>About me - Roland Plascencia</h1>
    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>In my senior year, I played on an undersized football team. I realized quickly that leadership isn’t about barking orders; it’s about creating an environment where everyone feels supported.
        When I saw the underclassmen struggling, I didn't just give them the "what" I gave them the "why." I went back to the fundamentals, explaining the reasons behind every movement. Even when tensions rose between players, 
        I stepped in to defuse the situation individually, prioritizing the unity of the group over ego. By keeping the atmosphere light with humor but stern with expectations, I watched a struggling group become the most unified 
        unit on the team. To me, leadership is building a bond with empathy, consistency, and trust.</p>
